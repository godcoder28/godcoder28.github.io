                                        Question 1.
                                        A small candle, 2.5 cm in size is placed at 27 cm in front of a concave mirror
                                        of radius of curvature 36 cm. At what
                                        distance from the mirror should a screen be placed in order to obtain a sharp
                                        image? Describe the nature and size of the
                                        image. If the candle is moved closer to the mirror, how would the screen have to
                                        be moved?
                                        Solution:
                                        The object is kept between ƒ and C. So the image should be real, inverted and
                                        beyond C. To locate the sharp image,
                                        screen should be placed at the position of image.
                                        <img src="images/ray-optics (01).png" class="answer">
                                        So, the image is inverted and magnified. Thus in order to locate the sharp
                                        image, the screen should be kept 54 cm in
                                        front of concave mirror and image on the screen will be observed real, inverted
                                        and magnified. If the candle is moved
                                        closer to the mirror, the real image will move away from the mirror, hence
                                        screen has to be shifted away from the mirror
                                        to locate the sharp image.
                                        Question 2.
                                        A 4.5 cm needle is placed 12 cm away from a convex mirror of focal length 15 cm.
                                        Give the location of the image and the
                                        magnification. Describe what happens as the needle is moved farther from the
                                        mirror.
                                        Solution:
                                        A convex mirror always form virtual image, which is erect and small in size of
                                        an object kept in front of it. Focal
                                        length of convex mirror ƒ = + 15 cm Object distance u = – 12 cm Using mirror
                                        formula
                                        <img src="images/ray-optics (02).png" class="answer">
                                        Therefore, image is virtual, formed at 6.67 cm at the back of the mirror.
                                        <img src="images/ray-optics (03).png" class="answer">
                                        It shows the image is erect, small in size and virtual. When the needle is moved
                                        farther from mirror the image also move
                                        towards focus and decreasing in size. As u approaches v approaches focus but
                                        never beyond ƒ.
                                        Question 3.
                                        A tank is filled with water to a height of 12.5 cm. The apparent depth of a
                                        needle lying at the bottom of the tank is
                                        measured by a microscope to be 9.4 cm. What is the refractive index of water? If
                                        water is replaced by a liquid of
                                        refractive index 1.63 upto the same height, by what distance would the
                                        microscope have to be moved to focus on the
                                        needle again?
                                        Solution:
                                        We know the relation
                                        <img src="images/ray-optics (04).png" class="answer">
                                        Now if the water is replaced by other liquid, the apparent depth will change and
                                        microscope will have to be further
                                        moved to focus the image. With new liquid
                                        <img src="images/ray-optics (05).png" class="answer">
                                        Now the microscope will have to shift from its initial position to focus on the
                                        needle again which is at 7.67 cm depth.
                                        Shift distance = 9.4 – 7.67 = 1.73 cm.
                                        Question 4.
                                        Figures (a) and (b) show refraction of a ray in air incident at 60° with the
                                        normal to a glass- air and water-air
                                        interface, respectively. Predict the angle of refraction in glass when the angle
                                        of incidence in water is 45° with the
                                        normal to a water-glass interface (figure c).

                                        Question 5.
                                        A small bulb is placed at the bottom of a tank containing water to a depth of 80
                                        cm. What is the area of the surface of
                                        water through which light from the bulb can emerge out? Refractive index of
                                        water is 1.33. (Consider the bulb to be a
                                        point source)
                                        Solution:
                                        As shown in the figure all those light rays which are incident on the surface at
                                        angle of incidence more than critical
                                        angle, does total internal reflection and are reflected back in water only. All
                                        those light rays which are incident
                                        below critical angle emerges out of surface bending away from normal. All those
                                        light beams which are incident at
                                        critical angle grazes the surface of water.

                                        Question 6.
                                        A prism is made of glass of unknown refractive index. A parallel beam of light
                                        is incident on a face of the prism. The

                                        by the lens. What happens if the object is moved further away from the lens?
                                        Solution:

                                        So, the image is virtual, erect, of the size 1.8 cm and is located 8.4 cm from
                                        the lens on the same side as object. As
                                        the object is moved away from the lens, the virtual image moves towards the

                                        following questions: (a) You have learnt that plane
                                        and convex mirrors produce virtual images of objects. Can they
                                        produce real images under some circumstances?
                                        Explain. (b) A virtual image, we always say, cannot be caught on
                                        a screen. Yet when we’see’a virtual image,
                                        we are obviously bringing it on to the ‘screen’ (i.e., the
                                        retina) of our eye. Is there a contradiction? (c)

                                        converging power of about 40 dioptres, and the least
                                        converging power of the eye lens behind the cornea
                                        is about 20 dioptres. From this rough data estimate the
                                        range of accommodation (i.e., the range of
                                        converging power of the eye-lens) of a normal eye. Solution:
                                        Here the least converging power of eye lens
                                        is given as 20 dioptres behind the cornea. If we can
                                        calculate the maximum converging power, then we can
                                        get the range of accommodation of a normal eye. (a) To see
                                        objects at infinity, the eye uses its least

                                        Question 26.
                                        A myopic person has been using spectacles of power – 1.0
                                        dioptre for distant vision. During old age, he
                                        also needs to use separate reading glass of power + 2.0
                                        dioptres. Explain what may have happened.
                                        Solution:
                                        Myopic person uses spectacles of power – 1.0 dioptre or
                                        concave lens of focal length ƒ =1p = -100 cm in

                                        <img src="images/ray-optics (66).png" class="answer">
                                        Similarly if the person uses spectacles of power + 2.0

                                        Question 27.
                                        A person looking at a person wearing a shirt with a pattern
                                        comprising vertical and horizontal lines is
                                        able to see the vertical lines more distinctly than the
                                        horizontal ones. What is this defect due to? How
                                        is such a defect of vision corrected?
                                        Solution:
                                        This defect is called astigmatism. It arises due to non
                                        spherical cornea. The eye lens is ideally
                                        spherical and has same curvature in different planes, but in
                                        an astigmatic eye due to non spherical
                                        cornea the curvature may be insufficient in different
                                        planes.
                                        In the given situation the curvature in the vertical plane
                                        is enough, so vertical lines are visible
                                        distinctly. But the curvature is insufficient in the
                                        horizontal plane, hence horizontal lines appear
                                        blurred. The defect can be corrected by using a cylindrical
                                        lens with its axis along vertical. The
                                        parallel rays in the vertical plane will suffer no extra
                                        refraction but the parallel rays in the
                                        horizontal plane will be refracted largely and converges at
                                        the retina, according to the requirement to
                                        form the clear image of horizontal lines.

                                        Solution:

                                        mm2. So, each side of image is I = 6.25−−−−√
                                        = 2.5 mm (Linear magnification) For the given magnifying
                                        lens of focal length 10 cm we can calculate the
                                        required position of object.

                                        Thus the required virtual image is closer than normal near
                                        point. Thus the eye cannot observe the image
                                        distinctly.
                                        Question 32.
                                        Answer the following question:
                                        (a) The angle subtended at the eye by an object is equal to
                                        the angle subtended at the eye by the
                                        virtual image produced by a magnifying glass. In what sense
                                        then does a magnifying glass provide angular
                                        magnification?
                                        (b) In viewing through a magnifying glass, one usually
                                        positions one’s eyes very close to the lens. Does
                                        angular magnification change if the eye is moved back?
                                        (c) Magnifying power of a simple microscope is inversely
                                        proportional to the focal length of the lens.
                                        What then stops us from using a convex lens of smaller and
                                        smaller focal length and achieving greater
                                        and greater magnifying power?
                                        (d) Why must both the objective and the eyepiece of a
                                        compound microscope have short focal lengths?
                                        (e) When viewing through a compound microscope, our eyes
                                        should be positioned not on the eyepiece but a
                                        short distance away from it for best viewing. Why? How much
                                        should be that short distance between the
                                        eye and eyepiece?
                                        Solution:
                                        (a) In magnifying glass the object is placed closer than 25
                                        cm, which produces image at 25 cm. This
                                        closer object has larger angular size than the same object
                                        at 25 cm. In this way although the angle
                                        subtended by virtual image and object is same at eye but
                                        angular magnification is achieved.

                                        (b) On moving the eye backward away from lens the angular
                                        magnification decreases slightly, as both the
                                        angle subtended by the
                                        image at eye ‘a’ and by the object at eye ‘α’ decreases.
                                        Although the decrease in angle subtended by
                                        object a is relatively smaller.

                                        (c) If we decrease focal length, the lens has to be thick
                                        with smaller radius of curvature. In a thick
                                        lens both the spherical aberrations and chromatic
                                        aberrations become pronounced. Further, grinding for
                                        small focal length is not easy. Practically we can not get
                                        magnifying power more than 3 with a simple
                                        convex lens.

                                        (d) Magnifying power of a compound microscope is given by

                                        (e) If we place our eye too close to the eyepiece, we shall
                                        not collect much of the light and also
                                        reduce our field of view. When we position our eye slightly
                                        away and the area of the pupil of our eye is
                                        greater, our eye will collect all the light refracted by the
                                        objective, and a clear image is observed by
                                        the eye.

                                        Solution:
                                        Here we want the distance between given objective and eye
                                        lens for the required magnification of 30. Let
