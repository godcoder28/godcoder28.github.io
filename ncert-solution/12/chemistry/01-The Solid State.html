                                            liquid and an amorphous substance. Quartz is the
                                            crystalline form of silica (SiO<sub>2</sub>) in which tetrahedral units
                                            SiO<sub>4</sub> are linked with each other in such a way that the oxygen
                                            atom of one tetrahedron is shared with another Si atom. Quartz can be
                                            converted into glass by melting it and cooling the melt very rapidly. In the

                                            <span class="solution-heading">Solution.</span> Higher the melting point,
                                            greater are the forces holding the
                                            constituent particles together and thus greater is the stability of a
                                            crystal. Melting points of given substances are following. Water = 273 K,
                                            Ethyl alcohol = 155.7 K, Diethylether = 156.8 K, Methane = 90.5 K.

                                            The intermoleoilar forces present in case of water and ethyl alcohol are
                                            mainly due to the hydrogen bonding which is responsible for their high
                                            melting points. Hydrogen bonding is stronger in case of water than ethyl
                                            alcohol and hence water has higher melting point then ethyl alcohol.
                                            Dipole-dipole interactions are present in case of diethylether. The only
                                            forces present in case of methane is the weak van der Waal’s forces (or
                                            London dispersion forces).

                                            (a) Ionic crystals are bad conductors of electricity in solids state as ions
                                            are not free to move. They can conduct electricity only in die molten state
                                            or in aqueous solution. Metallic crystals are good conductors of electricity
                                            in solid state as electrons are free to move.</p>
                                        <p>
                                            (b) Ionic bond is strong due to strong electrostatic forces of
                                            attraction.</p>
                                        <p>
                                            Metallic bond may be strong or weak depending upon the number of valence
                                            electrons and the size of the kernels.</p>
                                        <p>
                                            (ii) Ionic solids are hard and brittle.Ionic solids are hard due to the
                                            presence of strong electrostatic forces of attraction. The brittleness in
                                            ionic crystals is due to the non- directional bonds in them.

                                        <p>
                                            Semi-conductors are the substances whose conductivity lies in between those
                                            of conductors and insulators. The two</p>
                                        <p>
                                            main types of semiconductors are n-type and p-type.</p>
                                        <p>
                                            (i) n-type semiconductor: When a silicon or germanium crystal is doped with
                                            group 15 element like P or As, the dopant atom forms four covalent bonds
                                            like Si or Ge atom but the fifth electron, not used in bonding, becomes
                                            delocalised and continues its share towards electrical conduction. Thus
                                            silicon or germanium doped with P or As is called H-type semiconductor,
                                            a-indicative of negative since it is the electron that conducts electricity.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>(ii) p-type semiconductor: When a silicon or germanium is doped with group 13
                                            element like B or Al, the dopant is present only with three valence
                                            electrons. An electron vacancy or a hole is created at the place of missing
                                            fourth electron. Here, this hole moves throughout the crystal like a
                                            positive charge giving rise to electrical conductivity. Thus Si or Ge doped
                                            with B or Al is called p-type semiconductor, p stands for positive hole,
                                            since it is the positive hole that is responsible for conduction.</p>

                                            The ratio less than 2 : 1 in Cu<sub>2</sub>0 shows cuprous (Cu<sup>+</sup>)
                                            ions have been replaced by cupric (Cu<sup>2+</sup>) ions. For maintaining

                                            Cu<sup>2+</sup> ion thereby creating a hole. As conduction will be due to

                                            Suppose the number of oxide ions (O<sup>2-</sup>) in the packing = 90</p>
                                        <p>
                                            ∴ Number of octahedral voids = 90</p>
                                        <p>
                                            As 2/3<sup>rd</sup> of the octahedral voids are occupied by ferric ions,
                                            therefore, number of ferric ions 2 present = 2/3 × 90 =

                                        <p>
                                            In most of the solids and in many insulating solids conduction takes place
                                            due to migration of electrons under the influence of electric field.
                                            However, in ionic solids, it is the ions that are responsible for the
                                            conducting behaviour due to their movement.</p>
                                        <p>(i) In metals, conductivity strongly depends upon the number of valence
                                            electrons available in an atom. The atomic orbitals of metal atoms form
                                            molecular orbitals which are so close in energy to each other, as to form a
                                            band. If this band is partially filled or it overlaps with the higher energy
                                            unoccupied conduction band, then electrons can flow easily under an applied
                                            electric field and the metal behaves as a conductor.</p>
                                        <p>

                                        </p>
                                        <p>If the gap between valence band and next higher unoccupied conduction band is
                                            large, electrons cannot jump into it and such a substance behaves as
                                            insulator.</p>
                                        <p>(ii) If the gap between the valence band and conduction band is small, some
                                            electrons may jump from valence band to the conduction band. Such a
                                            substance shows some conductivity and it behaves as a semiconductor.
                                            Electrical conductivity of semiconductors increases with increase in
                                            temperature, since more electrons can jump to the conduction band. Silicon
                                            and germanium show this type of behaviour and are called intrinsic
                                            semiconductors. Conductors have no forbidden band.</p>

                                            generally found in ionic crystals where anion is much larger in size than
                                            the cation, e.g., AgBr, ZnS, etc. Due to this defect density does not
                                            change, electrical conductivity increases to a small extent and there is no
                                            change in overall chemical composition of the crystal.</p>

                                        <p>(iii) Interstitial defect : When some constituent particles (atoms or
                                            molecules) occupy an interstitial site of the crystal, it is said to have
                                            interstitial defect. Due to this defect the density of the substance
                                            increases.</p>
                                        <p>(iv) F-Centres : These are the anionic sites occupied by unpaired electrons.
                                            F-centres impart colour to crystals. The colour results by the excitation of
                                            electrons when they absorb energy from the visible light falling on the
                                            crystal.</p>

                                            (i) Ferromagnetic substances : Substances which are attracted very strongly
                                            by a magnetic field are called ferromagnetic substances, e.g., Fe, Ni, Co
                                            and CrO<sub>2</sub> show ferromagnetism. Such substances remain permanently
                                            magnetised, once they have been magnetised. This type of magnetic moments
                                            are due to unpaired electrons in the same direction.</p>
                                        <p>
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            The ferromagnetic material, CrO<sub>2</sub>, is used to make magnetic tapes
                                            used for audio recording.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>(ii) Paramagnetic substances : Substances which are weakly attracted by the
                                            external magnetic field are called paramagnetic substances. The property
                                            thus exhibited is called paramagnetism. They are magnetised in the same
                                            direction as that of the applied field. This property is shown by those
                                            substances whose atoms, ions or molecules contain unpaired electrons, e.g.,
                                            O<sub>2</sub>, Cu<sup>2+</sup>, Fe<sup>3+</sup>, etc. These substances,
                                            however, lose their magnetism in the absence of the magnetic field.</p>
                                        <p>(iii) Ferrimagnetic substances : Substances which are expected to possess
                                            large magnetism on the basis of the unpaired electrons but actually have
                                            small net magnetic moment are called ferrimagnetic substances, e.g.,
                                            Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, ferrites of the formula
                                            M<sup>2+</sup>Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> where M = Mg, Cu, Zn, etc.
                                            Ferrimagnetism arises due to the unequal number of magnetic moments in
                                            opposite direction resulting in some net magnetic moment.</p>
                                        <p>
                                        </p>
                                        <p>(iv) Antiferromagnetic substances : Substances which are expected to possess
                                            paramagnetism or ferromagnetism on the basis of unpaired electrons but
                                            actually they possess zero net magnetic moment are called antiferromagnetic
                                            substances, e.g., MnO. Antiferromagnetism is due to the presence of equal
                                            number of magnetic moments in the opposite directions</p>
                                        <p>
                                        </p>
                                        <p>(v) 13-15 group compounds : When the solid state materials are produced by
                                            combination of elements of groups 13 and 15, the compounds thus obtained are
                                            called 13-15 compounds. For example, InSb, AlP, GaAs, etc.</p>
                                        <p>12-16 group compounds : Combination of elements of groups 12 and 16 yield
                                            some solid compounds which are referred to as 12-16 compounds. For example,
                                            ZnS, CdS, CdSe, HgTe, etc. In these compounds, the bonds have ionic
                                            character.</p>
